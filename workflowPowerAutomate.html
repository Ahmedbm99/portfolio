    <p>
      During my internship, I had the opportunity to design and develop a 
      <strong>monitoring and management application for Microsoft Power Automate workflows</strong>. 
      The platform enabled <strong>real-time supervision</strong>, <strong>failure detection</strong>, 
      and <strong>role-based workflow assignment</strong>. 
      This project significantly strengthened my technical expertise and problem-solving skills.

    <h3>üîß Key Responsibilities & Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and implemented a <strong>.NET Core backend</strong> with background services for workflow monitoring.</li>
      <li>Integrated <strong>OAuth2 authentication</strong> with Microsoft Power Platform and frontend users.</li>
      <li>Built a <strong>React + Redux</strong> frontend for secure, responsive UI and centralized state management.</li>
      <li>Developed a <strong>role-based system</strong> (Admin/User) for workflow assignment and supervision.</li>
      <li>Structured a <strong>MySQL database</strong> to store and optimize workflow execution data.</li>
      <li>Implemented an <strong>alerting system</strong> to instantly notify admins of failing workflow instances.</li>

      ‚ú® This internship not only helped me enhance my skills in 
      <strong>.NET, React, OAuth2, Redux, and MySQL</strong>, but also gave me hands-on experience 
      in building <strong>scalable, secure, and user-centric applications</strong>.  
      A huge thank you to the team and mentors who guided me throughout this journey üôè. 
      I look forward to leveraging these skills in future challenges and projects.
