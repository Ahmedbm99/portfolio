      During my internship at <strong>Spark IT</strong>, I contributed to the development of a 
      <strong>web-based appointment booking platform</strong> for car repair services. 
      This project strengthened my <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> web development skills 
      and provided hands-on experience working within a professional development team.
